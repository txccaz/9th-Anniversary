        <h2>Our 9 Months Together — A Letter to You, My Heart</h2>

        <p>My love,</p>

        <p>Nine months ago, everything changed for me. And it didn’t happen loudly or dramatically—it happened in the softest way possible. Like a prayer being answered quietly. Like sunlight slowly rising over the ocean. Like God gently giving me the person I was always meant to love.</p>

        <p>That person was you.</p>

        <p>And tomorrow marks nine months of us—nine months of memories, of growth, of becoming something beautiful. Nine months of laughter, learning, tears, kisses, and everything in between. Nine months of your hand in mine. Nine months of your voice being the softest part of my day. Nine months of being yours, and you being mine.</p>

        <p>It’s strange to think that before I met you, I thought I understood what love was. I thought I had felt it. But nothing, <em>nothing</em>, compares to this. Because loving you has been different from anything else. It’s been deeper. Softer. More real. It’s the kind of love that makes the world feel less scary. The kind of love that makes ordinary things feel sacred. You have changed my definition of what it means to love and be loved.</p>

        <p>From the very beginning, there was something about you that felt familiar—like I had known you in a past life or dreamt about you before we ever met. There’s a sweetness to your soul that’s hard to explain, but I feel it every time you speak gently to me. Every time you laugh without holding back. Every time you look at me like I’m something precious.</p>

        <p>You have this quiet power. You don’t need to be loud or dramatic to take up space in a room. You just <em>exist</em>, and everything shifts around you. You have a calming presence, like warm air after a long rain. And even in your most chaotic, playful, unpredictable moments—there’s a steadiness underneath. A depth I fall deeper into every day.</p>

        <p>I love so many things about you, Joaquin. I love your voice—how it soothes me, excites me, moves me. I love your hands, the way they hold mine so securely. I love your face—the shape of your lips, your lashes, your eyes, your smile. I love your curls and how they fall just the right way even when you're not trying. I love how you smell. I love how you sound when you're sleepy. I love the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you laugh like your whole body is in on the joke.</p>

        <p>But even more than all of that, I love your <strong>heart</strong>.</p>

        <p>You have such a good, good heart, my love. You care deeply. You feel fully. You try hard—even when it’s hard. You protect what you love. You forgive with grace. You push through pain even when you’re tired. I’ve watched you carry burdens most people don’t even know you’re carrying—and still, you smile. Still, you give. Still, you show up.</p>

        <p>You make me feel so safe. Not just physically—but emotionally. Spiritually. You make me feel seen, heard, wanted. You make me feel <em>enough</em>. And that means more to me than I’ll ever be able to explain. I never have to be anything but myself around you—and somehow, you make that version of me feel like the best one.</p>

        <p>There’s so much I’m grateful for when it comes to you. I’m grateful for the way you hold me when I’m anxious. I’m grateful for the way you kiss me—slowly, like time doesn’t exist. I’m grateful for the way you say “I love you”—not just with words, but with your actions. With your patience. With your understanding. With your presence.</p>

        <p>I’m grateful for every time you’ve chosen to stay. For every time you’ve listened even when it wasn’t easy. For every time you’ve forgiven. For every time you’ve softened when you could’ve hardened. For every moment you’ve loved me in ways I didn’t even know I needed.</p>

        <p>Nine months with you has taught me so much.</p>

        <p>It’s taught me that love is not always loud—it can be soft and steady and sacred. It’s taught me that real love isn’t perfect—but it is <em>consistent</em>. It’s taught me that connection runs deeper than logic. That some things are felt, not explained. It’s taught me that God really does answer prayers.</p>

        <p>And if I had to go back and relive every one of these past nine months—the fights, the fun, the silence, the closeness, the joy, the confusion, the healing—I’d say yes a thousand times over. Because every step has led me closer to your heart. And that’s where I always want to be.</p>

        <p>Baby, I know we’re still growing. We’re still learning how to love each other better. We’re still figuring out how to communicate, how to hold space for one another, how to protect our relationship when life gets loud. But through all of that—my commitment to you has only deepened. My faith in us has only grown. My love has only gotten fuller.</p>

        <p>There’s no one I’d rather walk this journey with than you.</p>

        <p>There’s no one whose hand I’d rather hold through uncertainty. No one whose voice I’d rather hear when I’m sad. No one whose soul I’d rather mirror. No one else I trust to love me so honestly.</p>

        <p>You are my best friend. My peace. My joy. My home. My heart.</p>

        <p>And as we step into the 10th month together, I just want you to know—I am so <em>incredibly proud</em> of you. Of the man you’re becoming. Of how you’ve grown. Of how you continue to show up even when it’s hard. I see you, Joaquin. I see all of you. And I love every part.</p>

        <p>Forever isn’t a scary word when I say it about you. It’s not a wish or a fantasy. It’s a vow.</p>

        <p>Because nine months ago, I fell in love with your soul. And nine months later, I still wake up every day with that same love growing stronger.</p>

        <h2>Our Journey So Far — Every Moment, Every Memory</h2>

        <p>My sweetest Joaquin,</p>

        <p>As I sit down to write this next part of our story, I find myself thinking back on all the moments we’ve shared over these past nine months. It’s incredible how much time can hold — every laugh, every tear, every look that spoke louder than words. Sometimes I’m overwhelmed by the beauty of it all, how our lives have woven together into this tapestry that feels so perfectly ours.</p>

        <p>Do you remember the first time we really talked? When the walls around us fell away, and it was just you and me—two souls quietly exploring each other? I still get butterflies thinking about how natural it felt, like we’d been speaking the same language all along, even before we met. You were patient with me, gentle and kind, and I felt safe enough to be myself. And that feeling—that soft safety—is still the foundation of everything we’ve built.</p>

        <p>From those early days, I realized you’re not just my boyfriend—you’re my confidant, my partner, my greatest support. You’re the one I turn to when I need strength, the one whose voice calms my restless mind. There’s a quiet magic in the way you listen, the way you hold space for me without judgment. It’s a rare and precious gift, and I cherish it every day.</p>

        <p>Over these months, we’ve made so many memories. I remember the silly games we played just to make each other laugh—the playful challenges, the teasing smiles, the moments where we forgot the world existed outside our little bubble. Those moments remind me that love is not just about the big milestones, but about the simple joys too. It’s about finding delight in each other’s company, even in the quietest spaces.</p>

        <p>I also think about the challenges we faced—the times when life tested us, when we had disagreements or misunderstandings. But even then, we never stopped choosing each other. We talked through the hard parts, held each other accountable with kindness, and learned how to forgive. I am proud of how we’ve grown through those moments, how we’ve built a relationship that can withstand storms because it’s rooted in respect and love.</p>

        <p>One of the things I admire most about you is your resilience. Life hasn’t always been easy, but you meet each day with courage and grace. You inspire me to be stronger, to face my own challenges with bravery. Your faith, your loyalty, your dedication—to family, to God, to us—reminds me what true strength looks like. You don’t give up. You don’t quit. And because of you, I’ve learned that love is about showing up, even when it’s tough.</p>

        <p>I want to thank you for trusting me with your heart. For allowing me into your world, with all its beauty and imperfections. For being honest, for being vulnerable. It’s not always easy to open up, but you do it with such bravery, and it makes me love you even more.</p>

        <p>Every time you share your dreams with me, I feel honored. Your hopes for the future, your desires for who you want to be, your faith that good things are coming—they fill me with hope too. I believe in you, in us, and in everything we can build together.</p>

        <p>These nine months have taught me about partnership. About balance. About giving and receiving love in equal measure. I’ve learned how to be patient, how to listen, how to communicate with my heart wide open. And I know that you’ve grown too—because love is never static; it moves and breathes and deepens.</p>

        <p>I love how we support each other’s dreams. How you encourage me to be my best self, and how I want to do the same for you. We push each other to grow, to heal, to become better people—not just for ourselves, but for us. That is a rare and beautiful thing.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite parts of being with you is the way you make me laugh. Your sense of humor, your playful spirit, your ability to find joy even in small things—it’s a light in my life. When you smile, the whole world feels brighter. When you laugh, I feel like I’m home.</p>

        <p>I want you to know that I see all the ways you love me—not just the big gestures, but the everyday moments. The way you check in on me when I’m tired. The way you remember the little things I say. The way you hold me close when I’m upset. Those things don’t go unnoticed. They mean everything.</p>

        <p>I also appreciate how you accept me fully, flaws and all. You don’t try to change me; you embrace me. You love me when I’m strong, and you love me when I’m vulnerable. That unconditional acceptance is a gift I treasure deeply.</p>

        <p>As we celebrate nine months of us, I want to make a promise to you. A promise to keep loving you fiercely and gently. To keep choosing you every day. To keep growing with you, learning from you, and standing by you no matter what.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being you. For being my person. For making this journey so beautiful.</p>

        <p>I love you with everything I am,</p>

        <p><strong>Forever yours</strong></p>

        <h2>How You Changed My World</h2>

        <p>My dearest Joaquin,</p>

        <p>There’s something magical about the way you entered my life. Before you, I thought I knew what love was—what it felt like, what it meant to be connected to someone else. But the moment I met you, everything shifted. It was as if the whole world was painted in brighter colors, the air tasted sweeter, and my heart knew a rhythm it had never felt before.</p>

        <p>You changed my world in ways I didn’t expect. You taught me that love is not just a feeling—it’s a choice. A daily decision to care deeply, to be patient, to forgive, and to show up even when it’s hard. Loving you has been the most beautiful, challenging, and rewarding journey of my life.</p>

        <p>Before you, I often felt like I was carrying the weight of the world on my own. But with you, that weight became lighter. Your presence is a balm to my soul. Your kindness is a shelter in the storm. Your laughter is a song I want to hear every day.</p>

        <p>You’ve helped me see myself through kinder eyes. When I doubted, you believed. When I was weak, you were strong. When I was afraid, you held me close. You never judged my fears or my flaws—you loved me through them. And that has changed everything.</p>

        <p>You have a way of making even the ordinary feel extraordinary. A walk with you feels like an adventure. A simple conversation feels like a deep connection. A quiet moment together feels like home.</p>

        <p>I love how you challenge me—not to change who I am, but to grow into the best version of myself. You inspire me to be brave, to dream bigger, and to love more openly. Because with you, I feel safe enough to be all of me.</p>

        <p>You’ve shown me the power of vulnerability. How it’s not a weakness, but a strength. How opening up to someone else can create a bond so strong it feels unbreakable. And I want to keep building that bond with you, day by day.</p>

        <p>I love the way you love God, how your faith guides you and strengthens you. It’s one of the most beautiful things about you, and it draws me closer to you every time I see it. Your devotion reminds me that love is sacred, that it’s a gift from above, and that we are blessed to have found each other.</p>

        <p>I am so grateful for the moments we’ve shared—those quiet mornings waking up together, the late-night talks that stretch into dawn, the times we’ve held each other when the world felt overwhelming. Those moments are treasures I hold close to my heart.</p>

        <p>And even when life gets hard, when challenges come, I know we can face them together. Because we have each other. Because we’ve built a foundation of trust, respect, and love that nothing can shake.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being my rock, my shelter, my safe
